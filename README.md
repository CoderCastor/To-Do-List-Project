# To-Do List Project

## Overview

This C++ mini project implements a To-Do List using Linked List data structure. The project involves insertion and deletion operations on the task list. It incorporates concepts such as strings, switch case, conditional statements, loops, and utilizes the cstdlib and ctime libraries for randomness. The To-Do List displays 10 quotes with their writers, shown randomly at the beginning of task table/list.

## Features

- **Quotes:** Displays 10 random quotes with their writers at every time before viewing task list.

- **Options:**
  1. **Add Task:** Allows users to add tasks to the task table.
  2. **Mark Done/Undone:** Enables marking tasks as done or undone. Users can specify a task number to change its status.
  3. **Remove Task:** Allows users to remove a task from the task table by specifying the task number.
  4. **Table of Tasks:** Displays the task table in a formatted manner, showing task number, done/undone status, and the actual task.
  5. **Exit:** Exits the program.

## Implementation Details

- **Random Quotes:** Uses the cstdlib and ctime libraries to display 10 random quotes with their writers.

- **Linked List:** The project utilizes a Linked List to manage the tasks efficiently.

- **User Interface:** Provides a menu-driven interface with a switch case for user interaction.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CoderCastor/To-Do-List.git
```

2. Compile the C++ program:

```bash
g++ todo_list.cpp -o todo_list
```

3. Run the program:

```bash
./todo_list
```

## Usage

1. Run the program to see random quotes and access the To-Do List menu.
2. Choose options from the menu to add tasks, mark tasks as done/undone, remove tasks, view the table of tasks, or exit the program.
